# Mafia-Story
Our colored code does not work on IDLE. If we could present on Repl.it that would be great. For some reason, the colorama code doesn't work and instead of printing red text it will print the code for red code + the text. To resolve this issue. we would like to present on Repl.it.

imports:

import time
import sys
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style
